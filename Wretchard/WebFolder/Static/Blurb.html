        <h2>Richard R. Fernandez, Author and Software Developer</h2>
		<p>These pages are devoted to demonstrating the rapid development capability of the 
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wakanda.org/">Wakanda Web Framework</a>, an extraordinarily useful platform for creating quick, 
		data driven applications on the web.</p>
		<p>It will support remote data entry protected by a login. For convenience these can be social media logins of which Facebook is preferred.</p>
		<p>When deployed on the Amazon cloud these applications can be deployed in a very short period of time and employed to meet situations in
		which they must meet fast-moving or rapidly emerging conditions. By using the Amazon cloud as preferred hosting the application can be
		scaled up or down at need.</p>
		<p>It is ideal for campaigns or projects which require a very rapid gestation and available everywhere. The platform supports tablets and
		smartphones, allowing reach into the Third World countries and other remote places.</p>
