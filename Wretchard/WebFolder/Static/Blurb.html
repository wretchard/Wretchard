        <h2>Richard R. Fernandez, Information Strategy Consultant</h2>
		<p>Richard is an open source information operations analyst. Working with publicly available resources, 
		he specializes in describing political, military and economic situations in terms of information transactions.  
		Richard is best known for his internationally read weblog, the Belmont Club 
		(rated by surveys as the 80th most influential political site in the world). 
		He has been quoted by the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Times of London 
		to name just a few reputable publications. 
		He has been interviewed on US radio programs, co-authored articles with military commanders 
		and has been invited to review books, or write forewords and jacket introductions on books 
		varying in subject from cable warfare, military history and resource depletion</p> 
		<p>As a database and web developer, Richard has developed online sites along the 
		Principles of Information Operations. (See below) These allow social networks to develop 
		and grow around the capture, analysis and sharing of data to achieve the social network’s own goals.</p>
		<p>Examples of such applications are sample ballot sharing applications, 
		door-to-door survey cell-phone interactive forms and programs which analyze and disseminate 
		the voting records of legislators. These applications can feature advanced features 
		like social network logins and credit card charging facilities.  
		They can be linked to other open sources of data like Google Maps data is loaded dynamically 
		only as needed, eliminating the need for pre-loaded data sets.</p>
		<p>These  applications are rapidly developed through the use of Wakanda, a full-stack Javascript 
		framework currently gaining in popularity worldwide. This makes for robust and extremely scalable 
		deployment sequence.</p>
		<p>Applications have been developed entirely online via IM and shared documents, with developers in 
		both Australia and the US working simultaneously on the code. The rapid development possible on the 
		Wakanda platform means rudimentary functionality can often be available inside a week.</p>
		<h2>Core Services</h2>
		<p>The core professional services offered by the consultancy are:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Rapid website development using the Wakanda Javascript framework.  These include 
		domain registration and server setup for the clients.</li>

		and business strategy consulting advice.</li>
		<li>Professional level publication services, including editing are also available on a project basis.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Principles of Information Operations</h2>
		<p>This is a description of the Principles of Information Operations described below. These assert that:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Modern activity, including the economy, is becoming increasingly virtualized. 
		The Cold War transformed much of armed conflict into an exercise in signalling; 
		central banking turned money into a database entry; and modern media methods 
		increasingly mean that legitimacy a function of perception. 
		In a multiplicity of ways information has become the cornerstone of the modern world.</li> 
		<li>The resulting information explosion had two immediate effects. 
		First, the modern voter and consumer were overloaded with messages. 
		There were suddenly too many newspapers, DVDs, TV channels, satellite 
		radio programs and websites to possibly absorb. Second, the flood of information 
		to which the public was exposed contained a large noise component. 
		Political lies, marketing spin, hyperbole, or flat out fabrication.</li>
		<li>Social networks emerged in part as trust associations to deal with this information overload.  
		Over time they develop an internal informal hierarchy consisting of the reputation spontaneously 
		assigned to them by other members.  Social networks therefore become games, 
		in which actions have payoffs or penalties. The most common payoff is an increase in reputation.</li>
		<li>Social networks are the new villages. They act to evaluate information, transmit preferences and 
		diffuse adoption. Any politician, marketer or social entrepreneur will want not 
		only to ‘break into’ the village to spread a message but grow the social network to the maximum extent.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The 21st century is characterized by the heightened importance of the virtual. 
		To an increasing extent the reputation of a firm, a political movement and indeed any 
		individual is the online reputation. More people will know you through the network 
		than will ever meet you face-to-face.  The value of this online reputation is not the 
		cumulative effect of press releases or spin efforts. It is the collective sum of the 
		satisfaction felt by your affinity group as captured by the network.</p>
		<p>It is a mistake to think that social networks are only about marketing. 
		They are much more fundamentally about measuring reputation, ie ‘value’ of ideas, products and people. 
		They are about measuring the truth through the eyes of those who have collectively considered it.</p>
		<p>Applications and initiatives designed according to the principles of information seek a 
		competitive advantage in the truth, for “the truth will set you free” 
		quite apart from potentially making you successful and rich.</p>
