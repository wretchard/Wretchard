        <h2>Richard R. Fernandez, Information Strategy Consultant</h2>
		<p>Richard is an open source information operations analyst, who has been quoted by the major newspaper outlets on subjects
		as diverse as a foreign policy, information technology and military affairs.  
		Richard is best known for his internationally read weblog, the Belmont Club 
		(rated by surveys as the 80th most influential political site in the world). 
		He has been quoted by the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Times of London 
		to name just a few reputable publications. 
		He has been interviewed on US radio programs, co-authored articles with military commanders 
		and has been invited to review books, or write forewords and jacket introductions on books 
		varying in subject from cable warfare, military history and resource depletion.</p> 
		<p>As a database and web developer, Richard develops web applications that emphasize 
		the capture, analysis and sharing of data to achieve the social network’s own goals.</p>
		<p>Examples of such applications are sample ballot sharing applications, 
		door-to-door survey cell-phone interactive forms and programs which analyze and disseminate 
		the voting records of legislators. These applications can feature advanced features 
		like social network logins and credit card charging facilities.  
		They can be linked to other open sources of data like Google Maps data is loaded dynamically 
		only as needed, eliminating the need for pre-loaded data sets.</p>
		<p>These  applications are rapidly developed through the use of Wakanda, a full-stack Javascript 
		framework that is part of 4D and currently gaining in popularity worldwide. It makes for quick and extremely scalable 
		deployment sequence, ideal for organizations which are trying to capitalize on rapidly developing trends. In conjunction with
		source control tools like Git and communications services like Skype, Richard can help provide a solution to anyone in the world.
		In fact, although Richard lives in Australia, many of his clients are the United States.</p>

		</ol>
		<h2>Principles of Information Operations</h2>
		<p>These principles ought to guide web development strategy and applications should be designed in accordance with them:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Modern activity, including the economy, has become increasingly virtualized. Even the projection of force has acquired
		a narrative component.</li>
		<li>In a multiplicity of ways information has become the cornerstone of the modern world.</li> 
		<li>The resulting information explosion had two immediate effects. 
		First, the modern voter and consumer were overloaded with messages. 
		There were suddenly too many newspapers, DVDs, TV channels, satellite 
		radio programs and websites to possibly absorb. Second, the flood of information 
		to which the public was exposed contained a large noise component. 
		Political lies, marketing spin, hyperbole, or flat out fabrication.</li>
		<li>Social networks emerged as trust associations to deal with this information overload. They filter who you can trust and what reputations one recognzes.</li>
		<li>Social networks are the new villages. Any politician, marketer or social entrepreneur must ‘break into’ the village 
		to spread a message but grow the social network to the maximum extent.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>To an increasing extent the reputation of a firm, a political movement or an individual is an online image. More people will know you through the network 
		than will ever meet you face-to-face.  The value of this online reputation is the collective sum of the 
		satisfaction felt by your affinity group as captured by the network.</p>
		<p>It is a mistake to think that social networks are only about marketing. 
		They are much more fundamentally about measuring reputation, ie ‘value’ of ideas, products and people. 
		They are about measuring the truth through the eyes of those who have collectively considered it.</p>
